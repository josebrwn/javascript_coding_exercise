# Javascript Coding Exercise

## Intro

This is a Node.js coding challenge I received recently.

In this project, the developer is asked to write a function that passes a set of tests found in `test/test.js`. These tests *expect* to receive a set of JSON instructions describing how to redistribute funds between people according to ratios provided by the user.

This is a fun example of a back-end coding challenge in Javascript that also demonstrates the dilemmas a developer faces when defending a multi-hour project like this. Javascript projects are a universe: just when should you begin to stop, and step away from a solution?

This answer appeals to the principles of **Document First, Test Driven Development**. While there may be innumerable ways in which the solution can be improved, the tests are passing and therefore the code is complete.
